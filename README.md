# foxhole-intelarty

Currently creating a C# winforms version of my previously abandoned project (https://github.com/wolfyxk/Foxhole-NoSpotterArty)

Description: Visual version of a foxhole artillery calculator app.

Currently has basic functionality although I have yet to verify all the maths. so I would advise against using for serious gameplay at the moment, feel free to test and let me know the findings.
